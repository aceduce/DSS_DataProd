## NFL and Politics

This is an R Markdown presentation for the final week for Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch.
Here, I did a small project on the major league fan base political preference in the presidential election in 2016. This is largely utilizing the data and story from link below.
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-every-nfl-teams-fans-lean-politically/

Leagues in discussion includes NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, NASCAR and etc.

## Project

The project consists of 3 major components.

- Search times pulled from Google for the major leagues (big 3)
- Study the regression on the political preference for the fans.
- Plot the State maps for the NFL base fan preference.

## Datasets 

In total, 4 data sets included for the analysis. 

1.Search trending from google.
2.Vote data from 2016. Loaded into `corelat` to find the correlations.
3.Survey data from survey monkey
4.Team name for NFL and their located States.
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
trend<-read.table("multiTimeline.csv", header=T, sep=",", skip=2, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
corelat<-read.table("google_trend.csv",header=T,sep=",",skip=1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
survey<-read.table("surveymonkey.csv",header=T,sep=",",skip=1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
TeamState<-read.table("TeamByState.csv",header=T,sep=",",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
Some data clean such as removing % and translate the percentage into numeric values.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
survey[,i]<-as.numeric(gsub("%","",survey[,i]))/100
```

## Plots

Quite a few libraries are used to generate plots. Such as `ggplot2()`, `rcharts`,`nvd3`. Images are inserted in the project, such as `htmlOutput`. Classics such as `renderChart`,`renderText` etc.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
htmlOutput("PartImg")
```
Read html images with logic conidtions.
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
output$PartImg<-renderText(
    if( abs(modfit()[[1]][2]) <0.05) {
      c('<img src="',"IND.png",'",width="', '"90" ',"height=", '"70">')
    }
```
